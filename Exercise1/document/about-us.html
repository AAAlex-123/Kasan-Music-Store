					<p>From Elliniko. I like playing video games, drawing and music. I've been playing piano since junior high and my favorite musician is Bach. 
						Sadly, because of university and other studies, I was unable to continue my lessons in music theory but I hope that one day I will be able to
						continue. Music for me is an art, though I sometimes end up viewing it as a responsibility or something that has to be done. Understanding the 
						mathematical connection and being precise are what's more important for me. If I had the opportunity, I would like to be able to see it from another
						viewpoint. Regardless, I hope every music lover finds something useful in this store, either for their studies or their artistic pursuits!

					<p>From Spata. I like listening to classical music and analysing it, while also playing it on the piano. My favorite musicians are Chopin and Mozart. 
						Whenever I have free time, I invest it in learning new pieces and improving my techniques. For me music is more than a skill; it is a form of expression, 
						a peak into the soul of the artist. When I see other people play, I can understand and visualize their feelings at the moment, I can see through their mannerisms and 
						recognize true talent. Sometimes I find myself being disappointed by the fact that classical music is considered something difficult to understand or to even enjoy,
						but I think people who believe that have misunderstood it. I am making this website in the hopes that in the future, more people are going to pick up on the 
						art of music, but also as a tribute to my personal love for it.
